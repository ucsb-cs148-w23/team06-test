I am excited to be working on this team making a fitness and nutrition app! I was thinking about using React to create a
web application for this project since I think a lot of TA's have experience in this and will be able to easily help
us. For the application I was thinking about having many different features like custom workout builder that can allow
users to create and track their own weekly workout. Also we can have a place where users can track their protein goals
and keep a record of healthy recipes they have made throughout the week.
